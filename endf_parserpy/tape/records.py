"""ENDF-6 record-level helpers shared across the tape interface.

This module is the single home for the *structural* knowledge of the
ENDF-6 record layout that several tape submodules need:

* the fixed columns of the MAT/MF/MT control fields,
* parsing those control fields into integers,
* building synthetic control-only records (FEND/MEND/TEND and the tape
  head), and
* trimming the framing records (SEND, leading TPID, trailing TEND) off a
  list of raw lines.

None of this consults an ENDF recipe or interprets a record body, so the
helpers are cheap and independent of the parsing engine. Centralising
them here keeps the column layout defined in exactly one place.
"""

# record: MAT in columns 67-70, MF in 71-72 and MT in 73-75. These
# zero-based byte slices are the single definition of that layout; every
# tape submodule that inspects a control field imports them from here.
