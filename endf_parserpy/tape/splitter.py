"""Lexically split a multi-material ENDF tape into single-material tapes.

An ENDF *tape* may contain several materials. Each material is terminated
by a MEND record and the whole tape by a TEND record. This module splits
such a tape into chunks, where each chunk is itself a valid single-material
tape (tape head + one material + tape end) that can be handed to an
ordinary single-material parser.

The splitting is purely lexical: only the MAT/MF/MT control fields in
columns 67-75 of each line are inspected. No ENDF recipe is consulted and
the content of the records is never interpreted.
"""

# This synthetic record is only ever used as input to a single-material
# parser, so no trailing sequence number is required.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lines : Iterable[str]
        The lines of a (possibly multi-material) ENDF tape. May be a
        list, an open file object, or any other iterable of strings.

    Yields
    ------
    list[str]
        For each material on the tape, a list of lines forming a
        self-contained single-material tape: the tape head (TPID)
        record, the material's records (including its MEND record)
        and a tape end (TEND) record.

    Raises
    ------
    TapeStructureError
        If the tape does not begin with a TPID record, or if it ends
        in the middle of a material.

    Notes
    -----
    Blank lines (e.g. padding between materials) are not preserved.
