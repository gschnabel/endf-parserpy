"""Eager multi-material parsing and writing of ENDF tapes.

These functions add support for ENDF files that contain several
materials (multi-material *tapes*, including PENDF/GENDF files that
repeat the same material at different temperatures). A tape is split
into single-material chunks by :func:`~endf_parserpy.tape.splitter.split_materials`
and each chunk is handed to an ordinary single-material parser. The
single-material parser itself is used unchanged.

Each operation comes as a pair, mirroring the ``parse`` / ``parsefile``
naming of the single-material parser: the bare name works on an
in-memory ENDF-6 string, the ``_file`` variant on a file path.

    text : str
        The ENDF-6 formatted tape as a single string, as produced by

        To parse a file on disk, use :func:`iter_parse_tape_file`.

    Yields
    ------
    dict or FailedMaterial
        The parsed material dictionary (same shape as the result of a
        single-material ``parsefile``), or a :class:`FailedMaterial`.

    Notes
    -----
    Only one material is held in parsed form at a time, so the parsed
    data does not accumulate; for a tape too large to hold in memory at
    all, parse it from disk with :func:`iter_parse_tape_file`.
