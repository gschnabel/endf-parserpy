"""Structural index of a multi-material ENDF tape.

The index records, for every material on a tape, its MAT number, the
ZA/AWR identifiers read from the first HEAD record, the byte range it
occupies in the file and the byte range of every (MF, MT) section it
contains.

It is built by a single linear scan that inspects only the *structural*
parts of the ENDF-6 format: the MAT/MF/MT control fields (columns
67-75) and the universal HEAD-record layout (``C1=ZA``, ``C2=AWR``). No
ENDF recipe is consulted and no section body is interpreted, so the
index is cheap to build and completely independent of the parsing
engine.

The scan is memory-bounded: :meth:`TapeIndex.from_file` reads the file
in chunks and never holds it wholly in memory. When ``numpy`` is
installed and the tape is a uniform array of fixed-width records (the
common case), a vectorized fast path extracts every record's control
field in one bulk operation per chunk; it produces an index identical
to the streaming line-by-line scan it falls back to for any tape that
is not uniform-width.
